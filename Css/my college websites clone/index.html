        <h1>Founder & Secretary's Message</h1>
        <br>
        <p>It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Annamacharya Institute of Technology & Sciences website. I hope
          our website gives a glance at our institution. Our aim is to mould the rural children of this region as highly
          enlightened professionals endowed with innovative technical skills.<br><br>
          Education liberates people from the shackles of societal and economic inequities. It is a force that brings in
          happiness enhancing the living standards of rural families. All the children are not blessed with a chance,
          due
          to different reasons, to pursue studies in IITs and so called best institutions mostly in urban locations.
          <br><br>
          This is a group established in multiple locations to cater to the needs of the all sections of the society
          mostly from rural background. I humbly say that our vision and dreams have become a reality, as in these two
          decades, our institute has earned the distinction as one of the best institutes in the state. This became
          possible because of the wholehearted and untiring efforts of all the people associated with the institute.
          Still
          we have to thrive more and see that this institute is developed as the best institute in the country. I thank
          all the students, parents, administration and our faculty members who are trying their best to turn my dream a
          reality. I assure you that you will have an enlightening educational experience and wish you all the best.
